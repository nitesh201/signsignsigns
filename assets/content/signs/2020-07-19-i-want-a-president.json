  "body": "Zoe Leonard wrote *I want a president* in 1992, the year Eileen Myles entered the presidential race against Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Ross Perot. Although the magazine for which it was written folded before publication, the text still spread through informal channels, and its readership grew as it was copied and shared among friends. The genderqueer feminist journal LTTR invited Leonard to issue the text as a postcard in 2006, allowing the work to reach broader audiences worldwide. A decade later on October 11, 2016, the work was installed on the High Line to coincide with the U.S. presidential election. Although Leonard has noted that the text reflects its context in the early 90s and is different from what she might write today, it remains a relevant tool for questioning what we want out of our leaders and our society as a whole.",
