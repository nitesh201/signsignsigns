Clifford explained the exhibition’s goals as follows:\n\n> \\[Blood at the Root] focused our attention on the fact that all #BlackWomensLivesMatter and all #BlackGirlsLivesMatter. Relying on various artifacts, the curators narrated the experiences and resistance of Black women and girls (trans and non-trans) who have been brutalized, imprisoned and killed by the state and its agents. As part of this exhibition, we undertook research to identify the names of Black women and girls (trans and non-trans) who have been killed by law enforcement in the U.S.",
