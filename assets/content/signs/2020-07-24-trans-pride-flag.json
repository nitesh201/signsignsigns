  "body": "Transgender rights activist Monica Helms designed the transgender pride flag in August of 1999, debuting the design at an LGBT pride parade in Phoenix, Arizona, in 2000.\n\nHelms describes the flag’s simple iconography:\n\n> The stripes at the top and bottom are light blue, the traditional color for baby boys. The stripes next to them are pink, the traditional color for baby girls. The stripe in the middle is white, for those who are intersex, transitioning or consider themselves having a neutral or undefined gender. The pattern is such that no matter which way you fly it, it is always correct, signifying us finding correctness in our lives.",
