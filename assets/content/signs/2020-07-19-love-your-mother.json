  "body": "Responding to a devastating Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969, Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson organized a national “teach-in” to raise awareness about air and water pollution. Held on April 22, 1970, this teach-in became the first Earth Day. Environmental Action was born out of this event and quickly became a leading advocate for protective legislation. Most notably, EA garnered Nixon’s support for bills including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act. In 1970, the organization also exposed the “Dirty Dozen,” publishing a list of Congressmen whose voting history reflected a disregard for environmental concerns. Environmental Action’s push for transparency set a precedent: even when the organization fell into a period of latency, the list continued to be produced annually with the League of Conservation Voters. *Love Your Mother* was designed by Jerry Rotondi and Bob Matheo for the organization in 1972, and after decades of inactivity, the organization was revived in 2012 under the leadership of Drew Hudson.",
