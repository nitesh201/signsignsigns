  "body": "Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi started the hashtag #blacklivesmatter in July, 2013 after a jury acquitted George Zimmerman of Trayvon Martin’s murder. According to a 2016 Guardian study, black men between the ages of 15 and 34 were nine times more likely to be killed by police officers than other Americans. And CNN reports that from 2005 to April 2017, 80 police officers involved in on-duty shootings were arrested for murder or manslaughter, and only 35% were convicted. Multiple initiatives now track incidents of police violence to bring public attention to the epidemic.
