  "body": "GOD HATES GOD was created for signsignsigns by Paul Chan and Badlands Unlimited. The sign is an addition to Badlands’ *New Proverbs* series, which first appeared at the Women’s March on Washington on January 21, 2017. Chan draws from the language and aesthetics of the infamous Westboro Baptist Church signage, adopting their neon color gradients and off-kilter typography but inverting their hateful statements to critique the Trump presidency. The four original “proverbs” read GOD HATES TRUMP, FAGS HATE TRUMP, TRUMP DOOMS NATION, and GOD HATES IVANKA.",
